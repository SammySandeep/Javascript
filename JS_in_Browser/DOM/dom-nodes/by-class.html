        <p class="main">The Document Object model, usually referred to as the DOM, is an essential part of making websites interactive. It is an
            interface that allows a programming language to manipulate the content, structure and style of a website. Javascript is
            client-side scripting language that connects to the DOM in an internet browser.

            const elements = document.getElementsByClassName('main')
            for(let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++){
                elements[i].style.fontFamily = 'Arial'
            }
